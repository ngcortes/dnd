Notes:

- The battle with Lecrux continues. Lecrux will fight until he is either bloodied or his forces are largely decimated. He mainly casts spells to bolster his allies and weaken his opponents (not damage them).
  - this is a fight to the death. If the party fails to stop lecrux, he will flee with his remaining cronies. Traskar will descend down to Lecrux's lair to find the party. After some mourning, he will call to assemble "Daggerford's finest" which
  will be a party comprised of all level 2 and 3 characters, depending on each PC's level at the time of death.
  - if the party succeeds, they will receive 1000 GP from Traskar, 250 from Alessandra, and free stay at the 7-stringed harp from now on. Derval will ask inform the party of some jobs up in Daggerford that have been on his plate for some time he could use some help with. With that the party will depart Secomber with the day saved.
