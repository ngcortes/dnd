The Fundamentals of DMing

Things I want out of D&D games I run (how do I achieve them?... assuming we're talking 5e dnd):
====================================================================================
- have a session 0.5
 - I don't want to spend the entire first session making characters. people came to play D&D... so let's play!
 - spend half the first session making PCs, and the latter half starting the game. maybe give an extra half hour or so.
 - practice making a character yourself before starting the game. try to get the process down as quickly as possible.
 - spellcasters are going to take longer because of picking spells. make recommendations, but try not to be too pushy.
  - eg. if somebody wants to deal lots of damage, recommend spells accordingly.
 - probably just default to standard point buy. these days players rarely want to roll for stats.
 - default to picking equipment packs instead of buying with gold. faster and people rarely choose the latter option
 - if somebody really wants to spend time on making their character, do it before session 0.5.
====================================================================================
- being beginner friendly
 - never played before? what kind of character do you play in an RPG video game?
  - or what kind of character would you want to be in a movie, book, TV show you like?
  - this is usually a pretty effective question for class and race somebody would like to play.
 - make or use a cheat sheet for new players
 - if player is unsure about a character concept, talk with the other players or the DM
 - does it makes sense for this character to be in an adventuring party?
 - cliche is a good thing. use it, then make it your own.
  - eg. maybe somebody wants to be luke skywalker. start with that, but edit it to fit the party comp, setting, etc.
 - set expectations for PC behavior
  - know your role in the party (can I heal my fellow party members? what am I good at / bad at?)
  - PCs should tend to favor the party's motivations over their own
   - don't steal from other PCs
   - don't try to fight or kill other PCs without
   - don't ignore the party when they need you (healing, solving a puzzle, etc)
   - if splitting off from party for own purposes, keep it brief.
   - do ask what would my character do? ... and would that harm the party?
   - these tenets can be broken only if express permission is granted by the affected person(s)
 - be encouraging if there are experienced players in the party
  - put the spotlight on them on their first session for a bit.
  - give them a worthy intro to the party if they don't have something they don't already have one.
  - let them introduce their character, but keep the intro brief. they'll talk with you directly if they want to add detail.
 - allowing the party to be split, but facilitating keeping the party together
  - by and large d&d is a group effort. if people want to split up it's generally not a great idea, but there are exceptions
   - somebody may want to scout ahead (probably the rogue/thief)
   - a PC may have a personal matter they need to attend to
   - the party may want to shop in a town or city
====================================================================================
- A balance of gameplay types: social interaction, exploration, puzzle solving, combat
 - try to have 1 type of each gameplay at least every other session
 - find what your players like and be flexible.
 - if you prefer one to another, still include the others. the game will feel unbalanced otherwise.
====================================================================================
- give the PCs something to do (don't run a sandbox unless it's a group of experienced and self motivated players)
  - a clear goal or conflict goes a long way to get people into the game.
====================================================================================
- rated PG-13 to soft R (think a marvel movie, Indiana Jones, bond flick, etc)
 - cartoon violence good... but this ain't a horror movie
 - sex can be awkward, uncomfortable, and triggering. don't get too steamy and read the room.
 - use swearing sparingly or not at all (if there are kids at the table), or make some cursewords up!
====================================================================================
- running in a published setting (Grehawk, Forgotten Realms, etc)
 - i'm not a big world builder. no judgement for using an established world! (but no judgement otherwise either)
 - pros of using an established world
  - players can actually read up on the world independently to make a character, etc
  - a lot less brain power to read than to write (for the DM)
  - tons of adventures in the setting, can use them without heavy modification
  - if there's something you don't like you can change it.
 - cons of using established world
  - it's not your world... you don't have as much control of what happened or is happening in it
  - if you do change something it can feel inconsistent for the players
====================================================================================
- light campaign planning
 - we're busy people... don't burn yourself out by writing a novel. (you don't need to write one to run a good game)
 - do plan more if you're just starting out. over time you will be able to draw on your memory more than the stuff you wrote down.
 - random tables and percentile dice are your friends. make your own if you need to but you can probaby find some that are good enough.
  - https://donjon.bin.sh/ is a great resource
====================================================================================
- using off the cuff ideas mid game
 - if a player asks something about the world or environment you don't know, roll percentile dice :)
  - use percentile dice when there is a thing about the environment that is entirely left up to random chance.
    consider how likely something is, then roll percentile dice to decide whether that thing is true.
    - eg. is this door locked? the door is a room at an inn so probably... 80% chance it is. roll the dice to find out.
    - you can use this method in general so you don't have to write down as much.
 - if you have a suddenly really cool, crazy idea that seems like it would work, it probably will. do it.
  - I once had a wheelchair-bound villain and decided at the last second that he'd turn it into a mecha scorpion. best. fight. ever.
====================================================================================
- using adventure modules and campaign books as a rough guidelines
====================================================================================
- rules as guidelines
 - favoring game speed to rules accuracy
 - making good judgement calls when you don't know the rules
====================================================================================
- not taking the game too seriously, but taking it seriously enough
 - character death is something that people take very seriously... don't take it too lightly.
 - encourage metagaming. there I said it. wanna look something up during the game? do it.
  - discourage behavior that would give a PC a particularly unfair advantage.
   - no reading ahead in an adventure module.
====================================================================================
- regular communication with and feedback from players
 - is the game progressing at a good pace?
 - is anybody / anything making people (or you) uncomfortable?
 - is the gameplay... fun? is there something you want to see more or less of?
 - talk 1:1 about backstory, future plans, etc with each player. it makes each player feel special
  - this really adds to the experience. even simple things like describing what a weapon looks like goes a long way.
====================================================================================
- evoking an emotional response from the players
 - pace the game effectively
  - keep dramatic tension when needed... but give players a break in between
   - dramatic tension is making the players feel rushed, stressed, or otherwise in anticipation of something happening
  - try not to run 2 encounters of the same kind back to back... for the most part.
  - drip feed characteristics of your NPCs... they'll feel more dynamic.
  - keep plot arcs to maybe 3 to 4 sessions. 5 is on the long side.
 - making PCs feel like they're a part of the world
  - communicate regularly on backstory
  - incorporate backstory into the game
  - ask offline about backstory if you want to do something. get consent.
 - creating memorable and recurring characters
  - ask what would this character do? will it make a party member or members react in a particular way?
  - cliche is a good thing. use it, then manipulate it.
====================================================================================
- less is more
 - legendary magic items should be rare
====================================================================================
- make combat fun
 - use the environment
  - who has the terrain advantage? players or opponents?
   - terrain advantage can include elevation, cover, concealment, etc.
  - are there things in the environment you can use?
   - powder kegs that explode, bodies of water, rotting floorboards, traps that can be sprung...
 - look at each monster's special attacks, strengths, and weaknesses. and plan in their favor.
  - eg. if a monster has bonuses for fighting in a pack, pick other monsters of the same kind that will complement that ability.
 - have a central theme
  - could be 1 powerful 'boss' monster and several weaker monsters
  - countdown to some event (falling ceiling, defend something or someone for a number of rounds, etc)
 - run combat as quickly and efficiently as possible
  - keep talking between characters to a minimum
  - give time to strategize, but have a limit of maybe 2 to 3 minutes
 - give a good amount of mega knowledge to allow strategy and tactics
  - show the initiative to the players
  - show enemy HP to the players
  - show status effects / ongoing spells to the players
  - you won't have to explain as much to the players as things happen. All the info is right there.
====================================================================================
- leave players wanting more
 - 3 hour games (keep things brief, but long enough to progress story / characters, encounters)
====================================================================================
- consistent and regular PC progression
 - use a table to dole out XP and to set up encounters. try to level up every ~2 or 3 sessions
 - if unsure, giving too much XP is better than not giving enough.
 - keep the game challenging but fun
  - increase level of magic as PCs level up
  - make consequences of actions (not just combat) more serious as PCs level up
====================================================================================
- resolve PC actions in a sane and fair way
 - use the 'bounded accuracy' of 5e to your advantage (see https://theangrygm.com/marvelous-mechanical-miscellany/)
  - eg. difficulty of a skill or ability check is as follows: 10 means average, 15 pretty hard, 20 very hard, 25 thank you for playing
 - if somebody is going to just keep trying a skill/ability check... make something happen to hinder them
  - eg. I want to climb this wall. if I fail I'm just going to try again... eventually somebody or something is going to notice you.
