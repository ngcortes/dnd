The Fundamentals of DMing

Things I want out of D&D games I run (how do I achieve them?... assuming we're talking 5e dnd):
====================================================================================
- have a session 0.5
 - I don't want to spend the entire first session making characters. people came to play D&D... so let's play!
 - spend half the first session making PCs, and the latter half starting the game. maybe give an extra half hour or so.
 - practice making a character yourself before starting the game. try to get the process down as quickly as possible.
 - spellcasters are going to take longer because of picking spells. make recommendations, but try not to be too pushy.
  - eg. if somebody wants to deal lots of damage, recommend spells accordingly.
 - probably just default to standard point buy. these days players rarely want to roll for stats.
 - default to picking equipment packs instead of buying with gold. faster and people rarely choose the latter option
 - if somebody really wants to spend time on making their character, do it before session 0.5.
====================================================================================
- being beginner friendly
 - never played before? what kind of character do you play in an RPG video game?
  - or what kind of character would you want to be in a movie, book, TV show you like?
  - this is usually a pretty effective question for class and race somebody would like to play.
 - make or use a cheat sheet for new players
 - if player is unsure about a character concept, talk with the other players or the DM
 - does it makes sense for this character to be in an adventuring party?
 - cliche is a good thing. use it, then make it your own.
  - eg. maybe somebody wants to be luke skywalker. start with that, but edit it to fit the party comp, setting, etc.
 - set expectations for PC behavior
  - know your role in the party (can I heal my fellow party members? what am I good at / bad at?)
  - PCs should tend to favor the party's motivations over their own
   - don't steal from other PCs
   - don't try to fight or kill other PCs without
   - don't ignore the party when they need you (healing, solving a puzzle, etc)
   - if splitting off from party for own purposes, keep it brief.
   - do ask what would my character do? ... and would that harm the party?
   - these tenets can be broken only if express permission is granted by the affected person(s)
 - be encouraging if there are experienced players in the party
  - put the spotlight on them on their first session for a bit.
  - give them a worthy intro to the party if they don't have something they don't already have one.
  - let them introduce their character, but keep the intro brief. they'll talk with you directly if they want to add detail.
 - allowing the party to be split, but facilitating keeping the party together
  - by and large d&d is a group effort. if people want to split up it's generally not a great idea, but there are exceptions
   - somebody may want to scout ahead (probably the rogue/thief)
   - a PC may have a personal matter they need to attend to
   - the party may want to shop in a town or city
====================================================================================
- A balance of gameplay types: social interaction, exploration, puzzle solving, combat
 - try to have 1 type of each gameplay at least every other session
 - find what your players like and be flexible.
 - if you prefer one to another, still include the others. the game will feel unbalanced otherwise.
====================================================================================
- give the PCs something to do (don't run a sandbox unless it's a group of experienced and self motivated players)
  - a clear goal or conflict goes a long way to get people into the game.
====================================================================================
- rated PG-13 to soft R (think a marvel movie, Indiana Jones, bond flick, etc)
 - cartoon violence good... but this ain't a horror movie
 - sex can be awkward, uncomfortable, and triggering. don't get too steamy and err on the side
   of being brief and high level (eg. the door slams shut as the two of you get down to business, etc)
 - use swearing sparingly or not at all (if there are kids at the table), or make some cursewords up!
 - this makes for a more accessible and approachable game. you can usually appeal to a wider audience.
====================================================================================
- running in a published setting (Grehawk, Forgotten Realms, etc)
 - i'm not a big world builder. no judgement for using an established world! (but no judgement otherwise either)
 - pros of using an established world
  - players can actually read up on the world independently to make a character, etc
  - a lot less brain power to read than to write (for the DM)
  - tons of adventures in the setting, can use them without heavy modification
  - if there's something you don't like you can change it.
 - cons of using established world
  - it's not your world... you don't have as much control of what happened or is happening in it
  - if you do change something it can feel inconsistent for the players if it clashes with lore they read up on.
====================================================================================
- light campaign planning
 - we're busy people... don't burn yourself out by writing a novel. (you don't need to write one to run a good game)
 - do plan more if you're just starting out. over time you will be able to draw on your memory more than the stuff you wrote down.
  - I suggest using an adventure module as a guide, then tweaking it to your liking.
   - focus on finding the key plotpoints, characters, and locations. don't sweat the details of those things too much,
     just make sure that the core ideas of the module that you like are there. throw out the rest and fill in the gaps
     with stuff you do like. (https://theangrygm.com/ask-angry-be-prepared-for-published-modules/)
 - random tables and percentile dice are your friends. make your own if you need to but you can probaby find some that are good enough.
  - https://donjon.bin.sh/ is a great resource
====================================================================================
- using off the cuff ideas mid game
 - if a player asks something about the world or environment you don't know, roll percentile dice :)
  - use percentile dice when there is a thing about the environment that is entirely left up to random chance.
    consider how likely something is, then roll percentile dice to decide whether that thing is true.
    - eg. is this door locked? the door is a room at an inn so probably... 80% chance it is. roll the dice to find out.
    - you can use this method in general so you don't have to write down as much.
 - if you have a suddenly really cool, crazy idea that seems like it would work, it probably will. do it.
  - I once had a wheelchair-bound villain and decided at the last second that he'd turn it into a mecha scorpion. best. fight. ever.
====================================================================================
- using adventure modules and campaign books as a rough guidelines
====================================================================================
- rules as guidelines
 - favoring game speed to rules accuracy
  - in most cases moving the game forward is more important than getting the rules right.
  - when you start out you'll still be learning the rules... but I'd discourage relying on the rulebooks.
    Your brain and your common sense are more reliable. Unless there's a critically important rule that
    could be a matter of the life or death of a character, etc, just use your judgement.
  - if there is a dispute, do listen to what your players have to say, but don't spend too much time debating.
 - sometimes it's best to rely on your players to tell you a rule if you don't know it or remember it
  - eg. you may forget what a spell does when a player casts it... you can always ask what the spell does.
 - making good judgement calls when you don't know the rules
 - here's a great article on adjudicating actions: https://theangrygm.com/adjudicate-actions-like-a-boss/
 - encourage your players to tell you what their character is *trying* to do instead of just saying they make a skill or ability roll
  - once you know what the PC is trying to do, you can suggest a skill or ability to roll. that may start a dialog about what
    skill or ability check that should be made. that's okay, just don't take too long and make a ruling.
 - don't roll for something that is incredibly easy or impossible
  - if something is impossible, the PC can't do it. end of story.
  - if it's something super easy for a PC in the current situation, just let them do the thing.
  - do consider the stress level of the PC and how quickly they want to do a thing when asking for a skill check.
    these are huge factors in deciding whether a skill check is needed.
 - if there isn't a rule for something a player wants to do, turn it into a decision they can make
  - ie. instead of saying no, try to come up with something he PC could do that would be
    of equal value to doing something else
  - eg. there's no rule for disarming an opponent in combat. if a player wants to do that,
    you could maybe have the player take a penalty on their attack roll. if they succeed,
    they hit their target with the attack and disarm the opponent. the penalty should make
    the player decide between a regular attack and a disarm.
====================================================================================
- it's okay to rely on your players for some things
 - keeping track of events and NPC/organzation relationships
 - keeping track of party gold and items
 - keeping track of XP... to an extent
 - looking up rules or spells, class abilities
====================================================================================
- not taking the game too seriously, but taking it seriously enough
 - character death is something that people take very seriously... don't take it too lightly.
 - encourage metagaming. there I said it. wanna look something up during the game? do it.
  - discourage behavior that would give a PC a particularly unfair advantage.
   - no reading ahead in an adventure module.
====================================================================================
- regular communication with and feedback from players
 - is the game progressing at a good pace?
 - is anybody / anything making people (or you) uncomfortable?
 - is the gameplay... fun? is there something you want to see more or less of?
 - talk 1:1 about backstory, future plans, etc with each player. it makes each player feel special
  - this really adds to the experience. even simple things like describing what a weapon looks like goes a long way.
====================================================================================
- evoking an emotional response from the players
 - pace the game effectively
  - keep dramatic tension when needed... but give players a break in between
   - dramatic tension is making the players feel rushed, stressed, or otherwise in anticipation of something happening
  - try not to run 2 encounters of the same kind back to back... for the most part.
  - drip feed characteristics of your NPCs... they'll feel more dynamic.
  - keep plot arcs to maybe 3 to 4 sessions. 5 is on the long side.
 - making PCs feel like they're a part of the world
  - communicate regularly on backstory
  - incorporate backstory into the game
  - ask offline about backstory if you want to do something. get consent.
 - creating memorable and recurring characters
  - ask what would this character do? will it make a party member or members react in a particular way?
  - cliche is a good thing. use it, then manipulate it.
 - it's okay to present some easy-ish or no-brainer-ish challenges. in fact you should have these in your game maybe every other session
  - these make the players feel powerful. as they progress in levels and leave a level of challenge behind, it's important emphasize that
    the PCs got stronger and can more easily deal with that adversity.
 - fudge dice rolls. there I said it. don't show the players any rolls you make.
  - the dice you use as a DM are suggestions for how a scenario will play out. you have the final say.
    read how people are reacting at the table, think about the tone you want to set in your game or scene,
    then decide whether the die roll result makes sense for the emotional response you want to convey.
  - eg. if somebody is having a bad day at the able and just wants to clobber some monsters,
    I'd probably fudge some critical hits that some monsters roll.
  - do try to be subtle. this comes with practice, but fudging is better than not in my honest opinion.
    I would say I fudge maybe 10 to 20% of my rolls. Do try to limit fudging in very critical moments
    such as downing a PC. it can feel cheap or hand-holdy if you fudge too much in those cases. do it
    sparingly.
====================================================================================
- less is more
 - legendary magic items should be rare
====================================================================================
- make combat fun
 - use the environment
  - who has the terrain advantage? players or opponents?
   - terrain advantage can include elevation, cover, concealment, etc.
  - are there things in the environment you can use?
   - powder kegs that explode, bodies of water, rotting floorboards, traps that can be sprung...
 - look at each monster's special attacks, strengths, and weaknesses. and plan in their favor.
  - eg. if a monster has bonuses for fighting in a pack, pick other monsters of the same kind that will complement that ability.
 - have a central theme
  - could be 1 powerful 'boss' monster and several weaker monsters
  - countdown to some event (falling ceiling, defend something or someone for a number of rounds, etc)
 - run combat as quickly and efficiently as possible
  - keep talking between characters to a minimum
  - give time to strategize, but have a limit of maybe 2 to 3 minutes
 - give a good amount of mega knowledge to allow strategy and tactics
  - show the initiative to the players
  - show enemy HP to the players
  - show status effects / ongoing spells to the players
  - you won't have to explain as much to the players as things happen. All the info is right there.
====================================================================================
- leave players wanting more
 - 3 hour games (keep things brief, but long enough to progress story / characters, encounters)
====================================================================================
- consistent and regular PC progression
 - use a table to dole out XP and to set up encounters. try to level up every ~2 or 3 sessions
 - if unsure, giving too much XP is better than not giving enough.
 - keep the game challenging but fun
  - increase level of magic as PCs level up
  - make consequences of actions (not just combat) more serious as PCs level up
====================================================================================
- resolve PC actions in a sane and fair way
 - use the 'bounded accuracy' of 5e to your advantage (see https://theangrygm.com/marvelous-mechanical-miscellany/)
  - eg. difficulty of a skill or ability check is as follows: 10 means average, 15 pretty hard, 20 very hard, 25 thank you for playing
 - if somebody is going to just keep trying a skill/ability check... make something happen to hinder them
  - eg. I want to climb this wall. if I fail I'm just going to try again... eventually somebody or something is going to notice you.
====================================================================================
- always being 1 step ahead of the party
 - a bit of munchkin-y behavior can be fun, but left unchecked it can be very unfun very fast
  - can obviate challenges you set before the party (eg. immune to some status effect, party has the 'feather fall' spell so can't take fall damage, etc)
  - can render certain plotpoints irrelevant
  - can render NPCs irrelevant
 - get a good idea of each PCs strengths and weaknesses... then exploit them, but do it in good faith.
  - creating an encounter that challenges a party's weakness can feel pretty icky if done too heavily.
  - in some cases you may try a trap or encounter that the party bypasses. That isn't an issue.
    just know that that encounter won't work in future, so remove it from your bag of tricks.
